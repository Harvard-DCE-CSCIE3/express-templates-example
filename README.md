# Express Routers and Templates Example

This project demonstrates an Express application that uses routers to handle dynamic routes with route parameters. It also includes template rendering examples using EJS.

## What this example covers

- Route parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`)
- Router-level middleware
- Template rendering with EJS
- `app.locals` as a simple in-memory data store for demonstration purposes
- Using an HTML form and a POST route to add new photos

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
